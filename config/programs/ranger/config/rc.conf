# Which script is used to generate file previews?
# ranger ships with scope.sh, a script that calls external programs (see
# README for dependencies) to preview images, archives, etc.

# Use the external preview script or display simple plain text previews?

# Preview images in full color with the external command "w3mimgpreview"?
# This requires the console web browser "w3m" and a supported terminal.
# It has been successfully tested with "xterm" and "urxvt" without tmux.
